# Train SSD model with Tensorflow Object Detection API : 

TensorFlow Object Detection API is a framework for building object detection models using TensorFlow. It provides a collection of pre-trained detection models on the COCO, Kitti, and Open Images datasets. These models can be used for various tasks, such as object detection in images and videos, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks using transfer learning. The API also includes tools for evaluating and optimizing object detection models, as well as for training new models on custom datasets.
