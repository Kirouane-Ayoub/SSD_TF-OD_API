# Train SSD model with Tensorflow Object Detection API : 


To train an SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model, you will need to follow these general steps:

Collect and prepare a dataset of images and corresponding object bounding boxes.
Choose a pretrained base network, such as VGG or ResNet, and configure the SSD model on top of it.
Define the loss function and optimizer to be used during training.
Start training the model on the prepared dataset.
Use techniques such as data augmentation and early stopping to improve model performance.
Once the training is complete, evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set.
Fine-tune the model, if necessary, by adjusting the hyperparameters or adding/removing layers.
It is important to note that training a deep learning model like SSD can be computationally expensive and require a powerful GPU.
And you should also take care of the preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalizing and cropping images, and creating anchor boxes.

Additionally, you can use several libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc, to help you implementing the process.

TensorFlow Object Detection API : 

TensorFlow Object Detection API is a framework for building object detection models using TensorFlow. It provides a collection of pre-trained detection models on the COCO, Kitti, and Open Images datasets. These models can be used for various tasks, such as object detection in images and videos, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks using transfer learning. The API also includes tools for evaluating and optimizing object detection models, as well as for training new models on custom datasets.
